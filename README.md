# LMoFit-Advanced-L-Moment-Fitting-of-Distributions
A complete framework for frequency analysis is provided by 'LMoFit'. It has functions related to the determination of sample L-moments as in Hosking, J.R.M. (1990), the fitting of various distributions as in Zaghloul et al. (2020) and Hosking, J.R.M. (2019), besides plotting and manipulating L-space diagrams as in Papalexiou, S.M. &amp; Koutsoyiannis, D. (2016) for two-shape parametric distributions on the L-moment ratio diagram. Additionally, the quantile, probability density, and cumulative probability functions of various distributions are provided in a user-friendly manner.
